This app documents the consequences of climate change as they relate to human health, animal health, earth systems, the economy, and society. Users can explore the myriad effects of climate change, from an increase in vehicle traffic to an increased spread of malaria, and demystify one of the greatest threats to life on Earth.  All information in this app is from scientific literature and citations are present. Any inquiries can be sent to Lstegs37@bu.edu, including those about image rights, none of which belong to the author of the posts.  All work done by Lucas Stegman and Alex Piacentini, Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.
